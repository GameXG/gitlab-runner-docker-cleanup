## GitLab Runner Docker Cleanup

This is simple docker application that automatically garbage collects the GitLab Runner Caches and Images when running on low disk space.

## How to run it?

The tool requires access to Docker Engine.

By default the Docker Engine listens under `/var/run/docker.sock`

```
docker run -d \
	-e LOW_FREE_SPACE=10G \
	-e EXPECTED_FREE_SPACE=20G \
	-e DEFAULT_TTL=10m \
	-e USE_DF=1 \
	-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
	--name=gitlab-runner-docker-cleanup \
	quay.io/gitlab/gitlab-runner-docker-cleanup
```

## Options

You can configure GitLab Runner Docker Cleanup with environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CHECK_PATH 			| / 	| The path which is used when checking disk usage |
| LOW_FREE_SPACE 		| 1GB 	| When trigger the cache and image removal |
| EXPECTED_FREE_SPACE 	| 2GB 	| How much the free space to cleanup |
| USE_DF 				| false | Use a command line `df` tool to check disk space. Set to `false` when connecting to remote Docker Engine. Set to `true` when using with locally installed Docker Engine |
| CHECK_INTERVAL 		| 10s 	| How often to check the disk space |
| RETRY_INTERVAL 		| 30s 	| How long to wait before retrying in case of failure |
| DEFAULT_TTL			| 1m 	| Minimum time to preserve a newly downloaded images or created caches |

## Automated build

The image is automatically builded by `quay.io`.
